Optimized for Rasperry Pi 3+ with LoRa GPS HAT for RPi v1.4 from Dragino

Version 0.2 (01.02.2019)

New in this version:
- ACK handling implemented
- FANET MAC error checker implemented
- Receiver routines adapt to the OSI model
- Code improvements

Fixes:
- CRC error detection bit was not set corectly in the SEMTECH SX1276 LoRa Chip

Improvements:
- GUI routine improved

Known issus / To-do in the next version:
- Code improvements
- Forward mechanism
- Extensive memory usage during operation. Software crashs after a few days.

Following functions are implemented:
- Hardware detection and implementation for SEMTECH SX1276 LoRa Chip
- Continuous FANET RF monitoring (RF noise, received and transmitted packet) each 1 minute and each 15 minutes
- Reads weather data from MariaDB and send the information periodical over FANET (Service, Type = 4)
- Receives and stores position data in the MariaDB from each FANET unit (Tracking, Type = 1)
- Receives and stores name data in the MariaDB from each FANET unit (Name, Type = 2)
- Sends to each new detected FANET unit a welcome message (Message, Type = 3)
- Sends the ACK if requested (ACK, Type = 0)
- Updates periodical a "routing" table in the MariaDB -> for future use




Version 0.1 (05.01.2019)

First version for the public. Following functions are implemented:
